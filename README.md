Repo made to pass "Build a Celestial Bodies Database" for freeCodeCamp's relational database section.

Will admit I messed up in the planning phase of this certification project - For some reason I thought only 1 boolean was needed, so I lumped on a boolean at galaxy that wouldn't require a bunch of research.
I also didn't think about the fact that foreign keys had to be connected with each table, so I had to quickly find what galaxy and star certain entries were a part of and add them. Which is why there is some galaxy entries that's just the constellation.
It was getting late and I wanted to get the project done. So it's a bit messy in a sense, but at least it has been a lesson in being careful in reading the exact requirements, even if a site got a time limit (be it monthly, weekly or whatever).
